The following data comes from an experiment on caterpillars. The caterpillars were fed on experimental diets differing in their tannin content, and their growth was then measured:

```{r}
growth = c(12, 10, 8, 11, 6, 7, 2, 3.5, 3.5)
tannin = 0:8
```

We hypothesize that the higher the percentage of tannin in the diet, the more slowly the caterpillars grow.   
Test this hypothesis through a regression analysis.

```{r}
lm.result <- lm(growth ~ tannin)
summary(lm.result)
plot(growth ~ tannin)
abline(coef(lm.result), lwd=2, col="red")
```


A previous experiment, however, produced different results. In particular, the slope of the regression coefficient was -1.5. We can do a test to see if the slope we just estimated (-1.158) is statistically different from 1.5. In this case the null hypothesis is that the slope is -1.5, vs. the alternative hypothesis that the slope is more than -1.5.

```{r}
t = (-1.1583 - (-1.5))/0.2236 #slope 1 (tannin_estimate) - slope 2/ tannin_error given by lm
pt(t, 7, lower.tail = FALSE) #7=degrees of freedom, lower.tail=F check if it is larger (lower.tail=T check if it is same or less)

?pt
```


```{r}
confint(lm.result) #confidence intervals (at 95%)

?confint
```
