Remember that `df = (nrows-1)(ncols-1)`.

# Exercices

## Exercise 1

A fish survey is done to see if the proportion of fish types is consistent with previous years. Suppose, the 3 types of fish recorded: parrotfish, grouper, tang are historically in a 5:3:4 proportion and in a survey the following counts are found:

```{r}
freq <- c(53, 22, 49)
probs <- c(5/12, 3/12, 4/12)
chisq.test(freq, p = probs)
```


## Exercise 2

Chi-square Test for Independence is a statistical test commonly used to determine if there is a significant association between two variables.  For example, a biologist might want to determine if two species of organisms associate (are found together) in a community.

```{r}
r1 <- c(3,1)
r2 <- c(1,0)
chisq.test(data.frame(r1,r2)) -> Xsq

Xsq$observed   # observed counts (same as M)
Xsq$expected
Xsq$residuals
Xsq

?chisq.test
```


## Exercise 3

Latta et al. (2012) collected birds in remnant riparian habitat (areas along rivers in California with mostly native vegetation) and restored riparian habitat (once degraded areas that have had native vegetation re-established). They observed the following numbers (lumping together the less common bird species as "Uncommon"):

```{r}
birds_habitats <- data.frame(
  species = c("Ruby-crowed kinglet", "White-crowned sparrow", "Lincoln's sparrow",
               "Golgen-crowded sparrow", "Bushtit", "Song sparrow", "Spotted towhee",
               "Bewick's wren", "Hermit thrush", "Dard-eyed junco",
               "Lesser goldfinch", "Uncommon"),
  Remnant = c(677, 408, 270, 300, 198, 150, 137, 106, 119, 34, 57, 457),
  Restored = c(198, 260, 187, 89, 91, 50, 32, 48, 24, 39, 15, 125)
)
birds_habitats
```

```{r}
chisq.test(data.frame(birds_habitats$Remnant, birds_habitats$Restored))
```
